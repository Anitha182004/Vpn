Task 8: Working and Understanding VPN**

In **Task 8**, I explored the practical and theoretical aspects of **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**, which are essential tools for ensuring online privacy and secure communication.

 üîß **Practical Steps Completed**:

1. **Selected a Free VPN Provider**: I chose a trusted free VPN service‚Äîeither **ProtonVPN** or **Windscribe**‚Äîknown for their strong security and no-logs policy.

3. **Installed the VPN Client**: I downloaded and installed the VPN software on my device.

5. **Connected to a VPN Server**: After logging in, I connected to a VPN server, which created a secure, encrypted tunnel between my device and the internet.

7. **Verified IP Change**: Using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com), I confirmed that my IP address and virtual location changed after the VPN connection was active.

9. **Tested Encrypted Traffic**: I browsed several websites to confirm that traffic was flowing securely and there was no disruption in service.

11. **Disconnected and Compared**: After disconnecting, I noted the return of my original IP address and compared internet speed and performance with and without VPN.

13. **Researched VPN Features**: I learned about encryption protocols like **OpenVPN** and **WireGuard**, and reviewed the privacy policies of the VPN providers to understand how data is handled.

#### üìö **What I Learned**:

* A VPN hides your IP address and **encrypts your internet traffic**, making your online activities more private and secure.
* VPNs are especially useful when using **public Wi-Fi** or accessing **geo-blocked content**.
* They work by routing your traffic through a **remote server**, changing your apparent location and masking your identity.

#### ‚úÖ **Benefits Observed**:

* Enhanced online privacy and anonymity
* Secure browsing, especially on open networks
* Ability to bypass content restrictions

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations Noticed**:

* Slight reduction in internet speed
* Limited server options and bandwidth on free VPN plans
* Trust is required in the VPN provider‚Äôs privacy policy

#### üß† **Outcome**:

This task helped me gain both **technical skills** and **theoretical understanding** of VPNs. I now know how to set up and use a VPN, verify its functionality, and understand its role in personal and organizational cybersecurity. It highlighted the importance of encryption, data protection, and cautious online behavior.
